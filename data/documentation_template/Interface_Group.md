### **Interface Group Documentation Template**

### **Interface Group Name:** `YourInterfaceGroupName`

---

### **1. Group Purpose**

- **Description:**
  Briefly describe the common purpose or theme of the interface group.
  _Example: This group of interfaces is designed to standardize communication between various data storage mechanisms, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and file-based systems._

---

### **2. Common Responsibilities Across Interfaces**

- **Shared Purpose:**
  - Describe any shared responsibilities or functionality that the interfaces provide across the group.
    _Example: All interfaces in this group provide methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on different types of data stores._

---

### **3. Key Interfaces and Their Methods**

For each interface in the group, document the purpose and key methods.

- **Interface Name:** `YourInterfaceName1`

  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `methodName1(param1, param2)`
      - **Description:** Explain what the method does.
      - **Behavior:** Describe any non-obvious behavior or side effects.
      - **Returns:** Mention the return value.
      - **Exceptions:** List any exceptions or errors thrown.
    - `methodName2(param1)`
      - **Description:** Explain what the method does.
      - **Behavior:** Describe any non-obvious behavior or side effects.
      - **Returns:** Mention the return value.

- **Interface Name:** `YourInterfaceName2`
  - **Primary Methods:**
    - `methodName1(param1)`
      - **Description:** Explain what the method does.
      - **Behavior:** Describe any non-obvious behavior or side effects.
      - **Returns:** Mention the return value.

---

### **4. Usage Examples**

- **Example 1 (Basic Implementation):**
  Provide an example of how an interface from the group might be implemented in practice.

  ```python
  class MyClass(YourInterfaceName1):
      def methodName1(self, param1, param2):
          # Implementation here
          pass
  ```

- **Example 2 (Advanced Usage or Multiple Interfaces):**
  Show an example of using multiple interfaces together or implementing advanced features.

  ```python
  class MyAdvancedClass(YourInterfaceName1, YourInterfaceName2):
      def methodName1(self, param1, param2):
          # Implementation here
          pass

      def methodName2(self, param1):
          # Implementation here
          pass
  ```

---

### **5. Dependencies and Interactions**

- **Dependencies:**

  - List any modules, other interfaces, or third-party libraries that these interfaces depend on.
    _Example: All interfaces in this group rely on the `Logger` utility for logging operations._

- **Interactions with Other Interfaces or Classes:**
  - Describe how these interfaces are expected to interact with other parts of the system or with each other.
    _Example: Interfaces in this group are often implemented by classes that interact with the `ServiceManager` for lifecycle management._

---

### **6. Variations and Extensibility**

- **Known Variations:**

  - List any significant variations between interfaces in the group, or ways they might be extended.
    _Example: `YourInterfaceName1` is designed for synchronous data access, while `YourInterfaceName2` supports asynchronous operations._

- **Extensibility:**
  - Mention how new interfaces can be added to this group or how existing interfaces can be extended.
    _Example: New interfaces should conform to the same basic method signature pattern but may add specialized methods for new storage types._

---

### **7. Limitations and Assumptions**

- **Known Limitations:**

  - List any restrictions or limitations of the interface group.
    _Example: Interfaces in this group do not provide methods for transaction management, which must be handled externally._

- **Assumptions:**
  - Mention any assumptions made by the interfaces regarding state, environment, or input data.
    _Example: It is assumed that all data passed into these interfaces has been pre-validated._

---

### **8. Additional Notes (Optional)**

- Any extra details or considerations worth mentioning, such as implementation guidelines, version compatibility, potential future improvements, etc.
  _Example: Future versions of this group may include interfaces that support distributed transactions._
