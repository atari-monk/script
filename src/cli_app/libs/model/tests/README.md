# Running Tests

To run the tests for this module, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `model` directory (parent of tests):

   ```bash
   cd model
   ```

2. Run the tests **using** `pytest`:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

This ensures that `pytest` can correctly resolve the imports and run all tests located in the `tests/` directory.
